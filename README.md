This sample project demonstrates a basic usage of the [ViewAR Api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/viewar-api) using pure JavaScript without any framework.

#### Features:

- Insert models into 3D scene
- Move, rotate models in the scene
- Remove models
- Change materials of models

## install

This sample project is meant to be used by [viewar-cli](https://github.com/viewar/viewar-cli). If you do not have this tool installed you can use npm to install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g viewar-cli
```

To proceed you need a [ViewAR](https://www.viewar.com/) account. If you do not have an account you can create one for free in the [developer](https//developer.viewar.com/user/register) section.
If are not logged in or have created a new account you need to log in using the viewar-cli by entering:

```bash
viewar-cli login
```

Create a new project directory and navigate via terminal into it. Use the following command
to start a wizard which will help you with the initialization of a new [ViewAR](https://www.viewar.com/) project:

```bash
viewar-cli init
```

1. In the wizard select your user account.
2. In the next step you select `Sample project` and than `Vanilla sample`
3. In the following step you need to enter an app bundle id of your app. If you have no apps registered yet, you need to head over to the [ViewAR developer backend](https://developer.viewar.com/configuration/list) and create a new app.
4. Enter a desired app version (default: 1.0)
5. In the last step you may choose any of the trackers, since they are not used in this sample.

## development

Visit https://webversion.viewar.com/YOUR-BUNDLE/YOUR-VERSION/ to run your app in the browser. (For example: https://webversion.viewar.com/com.myCompany.ARapp/1.0/)

To start the local development server with WebGL support enter:

```bash
npm run start
```

The local development server without WebGL support (mock mode) will enable you faster development of the ui. To start the mock mode enter:

```bash
npm run start:mock
```

## deployment

to deploy your changes enter

```bash
viewar-cli deploy YOUR-BUNDLE YOUR-VERSION
```

you can run your app on an iOS device by entering the bundle id into the [ViewAR SDK app](https://itunes.apple.com/at/app/viewar-sdk/id1097511807?mt=8) available in the [AppStore](https://www.apple.com/de/ios/app-store/).
